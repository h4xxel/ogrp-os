This package comes with a pre-compiled image for you to easily be able to test the operating system.
The source code can be compiled and linked using nasm and ld.
You can use any standard make utility to auto make the OS, however installing (create an image file)
will be possible with the OGRP-FS driver for linux (yet to be written).

To create an image file one has to build the source files and put them on a floppy disk or in a disk
image in the following order:

Sector 1: boot
Sector 2-4: filetable

The rest of the files are placed in order according to filetable (see OGRP-FS documentation)
